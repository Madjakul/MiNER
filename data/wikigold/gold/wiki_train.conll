One	O

discovery	O
by	O
Dr	O
Harthoorn	B-PER

team	O
was	O
that	O
different	O
species	O

despite	O
being	O
of	O
roughly	O
equal	O
size	O
(	O
for	O
example	O
the	O
rhinoceros	O
and	O
the	O
buffalo	O
)	O
needed	O
very	O
different	O
doses	O
and	O
spectra	O
of	O
drugs	O
to	O
safely	O
immobilise	O
them	O

In	O
some	O
species	O
the	O
margin	O
of	O

is	O
very	O
small	O
indeed	O
