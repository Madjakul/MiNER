Carmen Cavallaro ( May 6 , 1913 -- October 12 , 1989 ) was an American pianist born in New York . He established himself as one of the most accomplished and admired light music pianists of his generation . Known as the " Poet of the Piano " , Carmen Cavallaro showed a gift for music from age 3 , picking out tunes on a toy piano . His parents were encouraged by a friend to develop the child 's musical talents and he studied classical piano in the United States . As a young pianist , he toured Europe performing in many capitals . In 1933 , Cavallaro joined the jazz band of Al Kavelin , where he quickly became the featured soloist . After four years he switched to a series of other big bands , including Rudy Vallee 's in 1937 . He also worked briefly with Enrico Madriguera and Abe Lyman . Starting his own band , a five-piece combo , in St. Louis in 1939 , his popularity grew and his group expanded into a 14-piece orchestra , releasing some 19 albums for Decca over the years . Although his band traveled the country and played in all the top spots , he made a particular impact at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco , which became a favourite venue , and which many years later , was to be re-visited in the same way by George Shearing and Mel Tormé . Other venues where he drew large and devoted audiences included New York 's Waldorf-Astoria , Chicago 's Palmer House and the Los Angeles ' Coconut Grove . In 1963 , he had a million seller hit with the song Sukiyaki . Cavallaro developed a piano style of glittering and rippling arpeggios to augment his melody , which was often arranged in thick and lush triple and quadruple octave chords . His musical interests and arrangements included dance music , particularly Latin rhythms , tangos and strict tempo dancing styles , as well as some pop and jazz arrangements of classical melodies . In this , he is often cited as being influenced by pianist Eddy Duchin . Liberace was greatly influenced by both Cavallaro and Duchin . All three shared a propensity for arranging classical piano themes in a pop idiom . Cavallaro also became famous through the medium of radio and film , firstly with his regular program on NBC during the 1940 's , The Schaeffer Parade , of which he was the host and later in films where he played himself , starting with Hollywood Canteen ( 1944 ) , then Diamond Horseshoe ( 1945 ) and Out of This World ( 1945 ) . His most celebrated film achievement was playing the piano music for actor Tyrone Power 's hands to mime , in The Eddy Duchin Story ( 1956 ) . Carmen Cavallaro died from cancer on 10th December in 1989 in Columbus , Ohio .

CBS Cable was an early cable network operated by CBS , Inc. , dedicated to the lively arts ( i.e. symphony , dance , theatre , opera , etc . ) . It debuted in October 1981 and ceased operations on December 17 , 1982 . CBS Cable was a personal project of CBS founder William Paley , who hoped it would blaze a trail for cultural programming in the then-emerging cable television medium . Its program offerings were ambitious and often critically praised . Nevertheless the network struggled , and ultimately failed , largely because of the reluctance of many cable systems across the United States to give it carriage , limiting severely its ability to attract both viewers and advertisers for its costly lineup of programming . Cable systems in the early 1980s had far more limited channel capacity than they do today ( usually only a few dozen channels in most cities ) . CBS Cable was competing for channel space by appealing to a select and relatively small upscale audience , while other networks coming on line at the same time such as MTV and ESPN promised larger and more broad-based viewership and therefore got cable operators to carry them far more easily . MTV and ESPN thrived and gave rise to additional companion channels within a short time , while the CBS Cable channel folded after just over 14 months in operation . Not to be confused with the CBS-operated cable network , Eye On People , which debuted in 1997 and soon turned into Discovery People , ultimately reorganized into Discovery Times .

Chad Edward Gaudin ( pronounced go-DAN ) ( born March 24 , 1983 in New Orleans , Louisiana ) is a right-handed starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball . Gaudin attended Crescent City High School in Metairie , Louisiana . He earned All-State and district MVP in his junior and senior years . Gaudin was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays right out of high school in the 34th round ( 1009th overall pick ) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft . He signed on August 23 , 2001 and did not play professionally until 2002 . He played in Single A in 2002 and recorded a 2.26 ERA which ranked him 10th in all of minor league baseball . On July 15 , 2003 , in his first start after getting called up from the Class A California League , Gaudin took the mound in the first game of a doubleheader for the AA Orlando Rays on the road against the Jacksonville Suns and threw a 7-inning perfect game , retiring all 21 batters he faced . ( Two 7-inning games is the standard for a doubleheader in most minor leagues ; Major League Baseball would later amend a rule recognizing only efforts of at least nine innings as official perfect games . ) Gaudin made only two more starts and posted an 0.47 ERA for Orlando before Devil Rays ' Manager Lou Piniella summoned him to the big league club . When Gaudin made his major league debut , he had become the youngest Devil Ray in club history at 20 years and 4 months and was the 4th youngest player in the majors . After posting a very respectable 2-0 record and 3.60 ERA in 15 appearances ( including 3 starts ) in 2003 for the Devil Rays , he went 1-2 with a 4.85 ERA in 26 appearances ( 4 starts ) in 2004 while splitting time with AAA Durham . On December 12 , 2004 , Gaudin was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for backup catcher Kevin Cash . Although he pitched well as a starter at AAA Syracuse , he was just 1-3 with a 13.15 ERA in 5 appearances ( 3 starts ) with the Blue Jays . Opponents had batted .470 against him in just 13 innings ( 31 hits ) . On December 5 , 2005 , he was traded to the Athletics for a player to be named later , who later turned out to be outfielder Dustin Majewski . Gaudin began the 2006 season for the Sacramento River Cats , the Athletics Triple A team . He was recalled by the Athletics after posting an 0.37 ERA in 4 starts for the River Cats and pitched in relief for the rest of the season for the big league club . In his first season as an Athletic , he posted various career highs and his ERA ( 3.09 ) and opponents batting average were the lowest of his career . His inherited runners to score was 20 percent which ranked fourth lowest in the American League . In 2007 , Gaudin was converted into a starter again when veteran Esteban Loaiza was on the disabled list to begin the season . His excellent performance as a starter in the 2007 season has made him part of the new ' Big Three ' that include Dan Haren and Joe Blanton .
Chamicuro is a critically endangered indigenous American language spoken by just a pair of aboriginal people in South America . The language is of the Chamicuro people who number between 10 and 20 . The Chamicuros live on a tributary of the Huallaga river , in Perú , in an area called Pampa Hermosa , meaning beautiful plains . As with all native languages in Perú , Chamicuro is by default an official language in the area in which it is spoken . A Chamicuro dictionary has been created , however no children can speak the language as they have shifted to Spanish . There is controversy in regard to whether Aguano is the same language , which one study ( Ruhlen 1987 ) says it is , but the Chamicuros dispute this ( Wise , 1987 ) , although this may be for cultural reasons and the languages may actually be intelligible but the different peoples do not relate to one another and maintain different names and connotations between their language or languages .

Christopher Bailey is a lecturer of English at the University of Brighton and is an occasional screenwriter for television . He wrote the script for the Doctor Who serial Kinda in 1982 . This script drew heavily on his own Buddhist faith and incorporated classic Buddhist terms such as dukkha , panna , karuna , devaloka and Mara --- indeed , " the Mara " was the name of the villain of the piece . The strength of his script led to Bailey writing a second story for Doctor Who in 1983 . This serial , Snakedance , was a sequel to Kinda . New script editor Eric Saward requested that Bailey devise another story idea , but neither the submitted outlines for May Time ( later renamed Manwatch ) nor The Children of Seth were taken further . As a result , the two Mara scripts were Bailey 's final broadcast work for both Doctor Who and television in general and he returned to a career in academia .
Christopher Penley ( born circa 1990 --- January 15 2006 ) was a 15-year-old U.S. schoolboy who was shot by a SWAT team on January 13 , 2006 --- and died of his injuries --- after he had briefly taken another student hostage in a classroom and then later holed himself up in an outdoor bathroom at Milwee Middle School in Longwood , Florida , with an Airsoft gun painted entirely black to disguise it as a Beretta 9mm . After the gun was discovered by a fellow student , he forced the student into the closet and shut off the lights in the classroom . The student immediately fled and informed security , who called the police . SWAT arrived on the scene shortly thereafter , while a negotiator attempted to initiate contact with Penley . After a twenty minute stand-off he aimed the pistol at Lieutenant Michael Weippert , who responded by opening fire . He was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center where he remained on life support for two days before succumbing to his wounds . A number of his organs were removed and used as transplants . Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said the boy was suicidal and would not respond to negotiators who tried to talk him down in the bathroom . Some students at the school told the media after the incident that they knew he had " something planned " . Police have been criticized for initiating action instead of waiting for Penley 's father to arrive so that his father might talk him out of the situation . The Orlando Sentinel reported that Ralph Penley was not told of events until after his son was shot . The Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated the shooting and found it entirely justified , as Penley pointed a weapon at the deputy . Christopher Penley 's organs were donated by his family . Chris Penley 's death gave 9 people vital organs . Christopher Penley has also had a game room at the Landmark Church dedicated to him and a Youth center . The youth center the Adolescent Life Coaching Center ( adolescentlifecoaching.com ) opened in honor of Christopher Penley 's memory and to give a place for the voice of youth to be heard .
Circuit Park Zandvoort is a motorsport race track located in the dunes near the town of Zandvoort , in the Netherlands , near the North Sea coast line . Although there were plans for races at Zandvoort before World War II , the first street race was held on June 3 , 1939 . A real circuit was not built until after the war , mainly designed by John Hugenholtz . The circuit was inaugurated on August , 7 , 1948 . Next year , in 1949 the circuit hosted the Zandvoort Grand Prix . It remained on the F1 calendar for 30 out of the next 34 years . The company that commercially ran the circuit ( CENAV ) went out of business , marking the end of Circuit Zandvoort . The track , owned by the municipality of Zandvoort , was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to Vendorado , a Bungalow park developer at that time . A plan to save the remaining track was made by a group of people and companies . In 1995 , CPZ got the " A Status " of the Dutch government and began building an international Grand Prix Circuit . One of the major events that is currently held at the circuit , along with DTM and A1GP , is the BP Ultimate Masters of Formula 3 , where Formula 3 cars of several national racing series compete with each other ( originally called Marlboro Masters , before tobacco advertising ban ) . The most famous corner in the circuit is the Tarzanbocht ( Tarzan corner ) which provides excellent overtaking opportunities . This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of Tarzan and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track 's designers named a nearby corner after him . On the other hand , many different stories about Tarzan Corner are known . Circuit Park Zandvoort played host to the first race in the 2006/07 season of A1 Grand Prix from 29 September - 1 October 2006 . In the history of the circuit , several fatal accidents have occurred . The older ' Classic ' Zandvoort circuit layout from 1967 is modeled in detail and can be driven in the Grand Prix Legends racing simulation for X86-based pc's . This was later converted to NASCAR 4 , NASCAR 2002 , 2003 and other simulations using a converter from website ' The Pits ' . The current layout is used in the SimBin game RACE 07 - Official WTCC Game .

The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) is a private , non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer , neurobiology , plant genetics , genomics and bioinformatics . The Laboratory has a broad educational mission , including the recently established Watson School of Biological Sciences . Seven Nobel laureates have been associated with the lab . Though the lab 's name and address reference the town " Cold Spring Harbor " located in Suffolk County , Long Island , New York , its headquarters are in fact physically located in the adjacent Nassau County village of Laurel Hollow .. The laboratory began its history in 1890 as an extension of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences ; in 1904 , the Carnegie Institution of Washington established the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor on the site . In 1921 , the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics . The Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made innumerable contributions to the sciences of genetics , medicine , and the then-infant science of molecular biology , and in 1962 its facilities merged with those of The Brooklyn Institute 's Biological Laboratory to create what is known today as Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory . In 1944 Barbara McClintock discovered at CSHL transposons ( " jumping genes " ) , for which she received the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . One well-known aspect of the Laboratory is its hosting of the experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase , and the work of Max Delbrüc and Salvado Luria . Another Nobel laureate scientist there was Richard J. Roberts . Nobel laureate James D. Watson ( who co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA with Francis Crick ) served as the Laboratory 's Director and President for 35 years , and later assumed the role of Chancellor . In October 2007 Watson resigned as a result of controversial remarks about race made to The Sunday Times in the U.K . Currently , cancer biologist Bruce Stillman serves as laboratory President . During the years 1910 to 1940 , the laboratory was also the home of the Eugenics Record Office of biologist Charles B. Davenport and his assistant Harry H. Laughlin , two prominent American eugenicists of the period . In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review their work , and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all efforts . In 1939 the Institute withdrew funding for the ERO entirely , leading to its closure . Their reports , articles , charts , and pedigrees were considered scientific " facts " in their day , but have since been discredited . However , this closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ( Immigration Act of 1924 ) , which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who , Harry Laughlin testified , were racially inferior than the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany . Aside from its scientific mission , the laboratory is host to world-class scientific conferences on a variety of topics . The first of the annual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Symposium on Quantitative Biology was held in 1934 . The Symposium in 1960 , Biological Clocks , was arguably the founding moment of the field of chronobiology . Now , over 24 meetings , in addition to the Symposium , for between 200 and 500 scientists , are held annually . The Banbury Center is a small conference center that holds discussion-style meetings for only 36 invited participants . These elite meetings cover often controversial topics in molecular biology and neuroscience . Salvador Luria and Max Delbrüc founded the Phage Course in 1948 , a course that trained many of the leaders of the new field of molecular genetics . The courses proliferated under Watson 's guidance and each year some 28 advanced courses are held for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who travel to CSHL from throughout the world . The laboratory also offers many programs for students in high school and college in biotechnology and biology . The lab is particularly well known for its contributions towards the training of young scientists , notably through the establishment of its Undergraduate Research Program in 1959 , its Dolan DNA Learning Center in 1988 , and the founding of the Watson School of Biological Sciences in 1998 .

Connecticut Classic Lotto is one of the games offered by the Connecticut Lottery . It is drawn twice a week , on Tuesdays and Fridays . The earliest version of the game began in 1983 as a pick-6-of-36 . Later it became a 6/40 game . The current 6/44 matrix was adopted in September 1989 . The in-state game underwent further changes , such as adding a cash option in 1997 , and switching to what proved to be an unpopular " wild card " version in 1998 . The name was changed to " Classic Lotto " , and the wild card ball disappeared , in May 1999 . The current game ( as of 2007 ) pays winners $2 for matching three numbers , with parimutuel prizes for matching more numbers . The jackpot is won if all six match . Top-prize winners choose lump sum or annuity within 60 days of claiming the jackpot . In the unlikely event that the annuity is chosen , the prize is paid in 21 yearly installments . The overall prize pool is 52% of sales , half of which goes toward the jackpot alone . As with all Connecticut Lottery games , the minimum age to play Classic Lotto is 18 . The Classic Lotto jackpot was most recently hit on June 8 , 2007 ; the jackpot is almost never shared by two or more tickets . Winners of Classic Lotto ( jackpot or otherwise ) have one year to claim their prizes . A Classic Lotto jackpot of $3.5 million ( annuity ) on a ticket bought in February 2006 went unclaimed . The Connecticut Lottery had several options for distributing the $2.1 million cash that would have funded the jackpot prize ; as of June 2007 , there has been no official word as to what the money will be used for . It is possible the money will go into future Classic Lotto drawings ; for a time in the mid-to-late 1990s , unclaimed jackpot cash was used to guarantee starting jackpots of $2 million , instead of the usual $1 million . Since Connecticut is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) , it is eligible to offer its other multi-state games . One of these is the annuitized jackpot game Hot Lotto , played the same as its flagship game Powerball ; however , Connecticut is planning to continue Classic Lotto into at least 2009 .

Cosham railway station serves the former village of Cosham , today a northern suburb of the city of Portsmouth in southern England . Opened in 1847 by the London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) , it is located on the West Coastway Line which runs between Brighton and Southampton . It is currently served by the South West Trains , Southern , and First Great Western train operating companies . Westward , the line through Cosham leads to Portchester and Fareham , eastward to a junction ( part of the local " Railway Triangle " ) between lines leading south to Hilsea and Portsmouth and east to Bedhampton and Havant . Although the nearest station eastward is Bedhampton , there are no direct services calling at both Cosham and Bedhampton . Passengers between these two stations must travel to Hilsea , the next station south on the Portsmouth line , and change trains there . Local Civic Trust organization The Portsmouth Society has expressed its concern regarding low levels of usage at the station and urged that local planning policies should encourage its use .
