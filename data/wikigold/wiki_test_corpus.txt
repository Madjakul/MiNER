While the comparisons have some basis , DRN are far from gloomy , just a bit ... cool. .. But this cool does not translate into pretension , just humorous and knowledgeable asides to their favourite artists , photographers and filmmakers " . Dark Room Notes formed in Galway in 2004 , recruiting drummer Shanahan in 2006 . They performed their first gig in Galway in December 2006 . With the release of their debut EP , Dead Start Program on October 12 2007 , the band embarked on a nationwide tour which began with gigs at Cyprus Avenue in Cork on October 9 , Spirit Store in Dundalk on October 10 , Tower Records ( 2pm ) / Crawdaddy in Dublin on Saturday October 13 and Roisin Dubh in Galway on Thursday October 18 .

David W. Snoke is a Physics professor at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Physics and Astronomy . In 2006 he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society " [ f]or his pioneering work on the experimental and theoretical understanding of dynamical optical processes in semiconductor systems . " In 2004 he co-wrote a controversial paper with prominent intelligent design proponent Michael Behe . Snoke received his PhD in physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . He has worked for The Aerospace Corporation and was a visiting scientist and Fellow at the Max Planck Institute . His research has focused on basic processes and phase transitions of electrons , holes , including nonequilibrium dynamics of electron plasma and excitons , the Mott transition from exciton gas to electron-hole plasma and Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons and polaritons . His research group at the university of Pittsburgh uses stress to trap excitons in confined regions , similar to the way atoms are confined in traps for Bose-Einstein condensation experiments . His book , A Biblical Case for an Old Earth was described in a review by Law Professor David W. Opderbeck , in the American Scientific Affiliation 's Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith as " succeed[ing ] admirably " in " establish[ing ] that the ' day-age ' view is a valid alternative for Christians who hold to biblical inerrancy " , but as " less persuasive " at " argu[ing ] for a concordist understanding of the Genesis texts and modern science . " Snoke was elected a Fellow of the American Scientific Affiliation in 2006 . In 2004 co-authored an article , with Michael Behe , a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture , in the scientific journal Protein Science , which received widespread criticism . Behe has stated that the results of the paper support his notion of irreducible complexity , based on the calculation of the probability of mutations required for evolution to succeed . Michael Lynch authored a response , to which Behe and Snoke responded . Protein Science discussed the papers in an editorial . On May 7 , 2005 , Behe described the paper in presenting arguments for irreducible complexity in his testimony at the Kansas evolution hearings . At the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial later that year it was the one article referenced by both Behe and Scott Minnich as supporting intelligent design . In his ruling , Judge Jones noted that " A review of the article indicates that it does not mention either irreducible complexity or ID . In fact , Professor Behe admitted that the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were used .

His ability to combine jazz and rock has put him among the top Indonesian guitarists . Budjana 's passion and talent in music , especially guitar , has been very dominant since he was in an elementary school in Klungkung , Bali . Budjana 's first teacher was a construction worker who lived nearby . He stole money from his grandmother to buy his first guitarHe prioritised guitar in his life , and started to teach himself by playing rock songs . He became more passionate about music , and was reflected when Budjana moved to Surabaya , East Java , where he took a classical music course , performed with a band and participated in many of music performances . After graduation , he went to Jakarta to pursue a career as professional musician . While there , he came across Jack Lesmana , a jazz maestro and father of jazz musician Indra Lesmana , who taught Budjana the philosophy of jazz . In 1976 , when he was thirteen , Budjana 's name started to be seen in the music world in Surabaya . Later , in 1981 , he bought a " real " electric guitar ( an Aria Pro II ) and started to play with many different people .

Diego Silang y Andaya ( December 16 , 1730 - May 28 , 1763 ) was raised as an Ilocano ; his father was Pangasinense . He was a revolutionary leader who conspired with British forces to overthrow the Spanish in the northern Philippines and establish an independent Ilocano nation . His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish tributes and abuses , and his belief in self-government , that the administration and leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and government in the Ilocos Region ( which at this time did not include Pangasinan ) should be led by trained Ilocano officials . Born in Aringay , Pangasinan ( an area in present-day Caba or Aringay , La Union ) , he worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in Vigan , Ilocos Sur . Bright , passionate and fluent in Spanish , he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to Manila , journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seeds of rebellion . Spain allied with France during the Seven Years ' War against Great Britain . In so doing , the British sought to diminish the Spanish Empire . British naval forces took over Manila in October 1762 , that inspired uprisings in the farthest north of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan , where anti-Spanish sentiments festered . While Silang initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the Ilocos with native officials , and volunteered to head Ilocano forces against the British , desperate Spanish administrators transferred their powers to the Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia ( Vigan ) who in turn rejected Silang 's call . Silang 's group attacked the city and imprisoned its priests . He then began an association with the British who appointed him governor of the Ilocos on their behalf and promised him military reinforcement . The British force never materialized . He was killed by one of his friends , a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named Miguel Vicos who was paid by church authorities to assassinate him . After Diego Silang 's death , his wife , Josefa Gabriela , took over the revolt and fought courageously . A strong force was sent against her . She was forced to retreat to Abra . Riding a fast horse , Gabriela led her troops towards Vigan , but she was driven back . She fled again to Abra , where she was captured . On September 20 , 1763 , she and about 100 followers were executed by the Spanish authorities .

Digilogue is a music album of recordings which became the twentieth commercial release by the British avant-garde music group : zoviet*france : . It was first released in 1996 in limited edition 12 inch clear vinyl album format by the US record label , Soleilmoon Recordings . Subsequently , a CD version was released in 1998 by Soleilmoon Recordings , with additional tracks . The album 's title is an amalgamation of the words ' digital ' and ' analogue ' , two of the principal technologies that have been used in sound recording . The group have been quoted as adopting the failings in these technologies as a production technique in the creation of the album : " All audio equipment distorts sound to some degree and , eventually through mechanical and electrical failure , fucks it up . Since indeterminacy as a compositional parameter has been a constant in our work , this often produces what we regard as interesting new developments . digilogue was recorded using a mixture of failing analogue equipment and high-end digital equipment , and monitored in our studio exclusively on damaged hi-fi speakers . Sound can be as dirty and as clumsy as anything else we perceive with our senses . This is just as true of sound generated in the digital domain , much as we would all like to believe the claims of near-perfection made by audio equipment manufacturers . " " We were using digital equipment to produce the music but in a very analogue way . We were using sampling processes but in a very clumsy and coarse way . " Amber , from the CD version of the album , was used as the soundtrack to The Shop Floor , a video production by the artist Francis Gomila ( UK , 2003 ) . 1996 edition

The island of Divar ( Divar-derived from the word Dipavati or ' small Island ' in Konkani ) lies in the state of Goa , India . It is located approximately 10 km from Panaji ( Panjim ) , and is approachable by ferry . The Island is connected to Old Goa on the south-east side , Ribandar , on the south-west side and Narve on the north side , all by ferry . A launch also connects Divar to the city of Panaji from further north-west , in the village of Vanxim . The Konkan Railway passes through the village and the nearest stop to the village is the train station at Karmali . The drive to the village is scenic , with paddy fields and wooded hills lacing the roadway , very typical of the Goan countryside . Though in a manner equally typical of modern Goa , of late the paddy fields lie fallow and overrun with weeds . The Island of Divar was a famous site of Hindu pilgrimage and hosted the the ancient temples of Shree Saptakoteshwar , Shree Ganesh and Shree Dwarkeshwar besides others . These were irreversibly destroyed by Portuguese zealots in the 16th century in their drive for Christianisation of Goa . The ancient site of Hindu pilgrimage is called Porne Tirth ( Old pilgrim spot-in Konkani ) even today . Rui Gomez Pereira in his book Goan temples and deities writes , " The original temple ( Of Shree Saptakoteshwar ) was constructed in the 12th century by the kings of Kadamba dynasty . Shree Saptakoteshwar was the patron Deity of the Kadambas . It was destroyed by the sultan of the Deccan in the middle of the 14th century and reconstructed at the same locality by Madhav Mantri of Vijaynagar at the close of the same century . It was again destroyed by the Portuguese in 1540 . " The Saptakoteshwar idol was shifted to Narve in Bicholim after the destruction of the temple by the Portuguese . The present temple in Narve , Bicholim was rebuilt by ShivajiRaje Bhonsale the Great Maratha leader . A Jesuit priest Fr Francisco Sousa documented the religious importance of " Divar " in his book Oriente Conquistado ( Conquest of the orient ) around the latter quarter of the 16th or early 17th century . Fr. Sousa testifies that " Divar was as much venerated by the Hindu Brahmins as the Holy land by us , on account of a temple of many indulgences and pilgrimages. .. " Rui Gomez Pereira details further stating , " The linga of the temple , made of five metals - gold , silver , copper , iron and bronze " was later relocated in Bicholim . And on the foundations of the same temple a prayer and catechism house was constructed in 1563 , which was later transformed into the chapel of Our Lady of Cande laria . " The original inhabitants of this island were people who once lived in Old Goa but had to desert during a disastrous pest that greatly reduced the population of Old Goa . Piedade , a small village is spread at the bottom of a small forested hillock on which there is the Church of Our Lady of Compassion . The island is dotted with well maintained , elegant Portuguese villas . From the top of the hill , superb panoramic views of the surrounding countryside , including Old Goa , the capital of Goa , Panaji , the meandering Mandovi river , and the bridges across it can be seen . The famous Bonderam festival is celebrated in Divar on the fourth Saturday of August during the monsoon with great fanfare and attended by thousands of tourists and locals . Bonderam Festival : The festival is a memoir to the dispute and the fury of the Villagers over the Portuguese system of resolving the disputes . The villagers on the Divar Island often indulged in some kind of fight over the matter of ownership of their lands . To stop the disputes the Portuguese , put up flags at the boundaries . The villagers did not like this system . So they protested against the Portuguese by throwing stones at the flags . On this day a carnival ambience is created . Each section of the village has a float at the parade . Melodious music could be heard throughout the village . The gaily colored floats accompanied by colorfully dressed youngsters make a pretty picture . The huge bell which today adorns the Se Cathedral in Old Goa was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who 'd made a vow that , were he to survive his fate , he would donate the ship 's bell to the first church village , town , or city his vessel touched . It so happened that that island was Divar . In keeping with his promise , he donated the bell to the church of Divar , which is located on a high hillock . Unfortunately though , every time the bell was struck , it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity , so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with that of the Se Cathedral .
Dorothea von Schlegel ( née Brende Mendelssohn ) ( October 24 1764 - August 3 1839 ) was a German novelist and translator . Dorothea von Schlegel was born in 1764 in Berlin [1 ] . Oldest daughter of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn , a leading figure in the German Enlightenment ( Aufklarung ) . She married the merchant and banker Simon Veit in 1783 . Their son , Philipp Veit , would later become part of a circle of German Christian painters called " the Nazarenes , " who influenced the later English painters in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . She met the poet and critic Friedrich von Schlegel in the salon of her friend Henriette Herz , after which she left her husband . They were divorced in 1799 . She obtained custody of her younger son , Phillip , and lived with him at the Ziegelstraße , which became a salon frequented by Tieck , Schelling , the Schlegel brothers , and Novalis . Schlegel 's novel " Lucinde " ( 1799 ) was seen as an account of their affair , causing a scandal in German literary circles . In 1801 her novel " Florentin " was published anonymously by Schlegel . They lived in Paris from 1802 until 1804 , and after her divorce they married as Protestants . In 1807lt she translated " Corinne " by Madame de Staë from the French . In 1808 , Friedrich and Dorothea converted to Catholicism . ( She may have adopted the name " Dorothea " from a 17th century Dorothea von Schlegel who composed Catholic hymns ) . They continued to visit the salons of Rahel Levin and Henriette Herz , as well as the constellation which surrounded Madame de Staë . Friedrich died in 1829 , after which she moved to Frankfurt am Main . There , she lived with her son Philipp ( also a convert to a medieval style of Catholicism ) until her death in 1839 . Since she was the daughter of the greatest Jewish philosopher of the Enlightenment - Moses Mendelssohn - ( of equal stature with Immanuel Kant , and translator of John Locke and Alexander Pope , as well as Hebrew scriptures into German ) , Dorothea was surrounded throughout her life by the leading poets , critics , musicians , novelists , and philosophers of Europe . Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was her father 's closest friend and colleague , and the Emancipation and secularization of the Jews and Jewish culture was a direct outcome of their work . ( Mendelssohn was the model for Nathan der Weise in Lessing 's play of the same name . ) Friedrich the Great was Lessing 's patron , and he extended royal protection and sponsorship to Mendelssohn , as well . Dorothea 's brother , Joseph , was a friend and sponsor of Alexander von Humboldt , the great naturalist and ethnologist . Her nephew was Felix Mendelssohn , the composer , who with his sister , Fanny , were considered nearly the equals of the Mozarts as child prodigies . To fully appreciate the importance of this cultural scene , see the entries for Moses Mendelssohn , Gotthold Ephraim Lessing , Friedrich Schlegel , Germaine de Staë , Felix Mendelssohn , Ludwi Tieck , Novalis , and others . Dorothea was the common link or nexus among them all . Most of her work , letters , biographies , etc. seem to be available only in German . And there , with the legacy of the Holocaust , she would seem to have an ambiguous status . The emancipation of European Jewry , in which she and her family played the greatest imaginable role , became the main target of the Third Reich and its Nuremberg Laws . For some Jews , she may be a less than admirable figure as well , having left her Jewish husband , violated her divorce settlement , and converted first to Protestantism ( which was favorable towards Judaism ) , and finally to Catholicism ( which was not ) . Most of her later friends were Christians , assimilated or intermarried Jews ( like Rahel Levin ) , or secular Deists and materialists . Her association with Germaine de Staë was obviously of the greatest importance , since she was also the patron and literary companion of Dorothea 's second husband , Friedrich Schlegel . De Staë was the daughter of Jacques Necker , Louis XVI 's finance minister , and a leading figure in the collapse of the Bourbons and the French Revolution . ( See Christopher Herrold 's " Mistress to an Age . " ) It was probably through de Staë 's husband , a Swedish Count , that the Schlegel 's were granted a title of nobility in the Swedish court . [ 1 ] In older literature and on her gravestone one finds the date 1763 , but this is the birthyear of her older sister Sara ( May 23rd 1763-April 15 1764 ) whose untimely death was one of the reasons Moses Mendelssohn wrote the Phaedon . ( Alexander Altmann , Moses Mendelssohn , London 1973 , Moses Mendelssohn , Jubilaeumsausgabe , Bd . 12,1 , S . 43 ; letter to Thomas Abbt , May 1st 1764 )

Duane Bobick ( born 24 August , 1950 in Little Falls , Minnesota ) was a boxer from the United States , who became world amateur heavyweight champion in 1971 , and also won the gold medal at the 1971 Pan American Games . He fought for the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , West Germany , and later contended for the world heavyweight belt during the division 's most highly rated era . Bobick 's younger brother Rodney Bobick was also a heavyweight boxer , though less successful , and died in a single car crash in 1977 . Six foot , three inches tall and 215 pounds in his prime , Bobick was part of a boxing family and grew up with the sport in the 1960s . A tremendous puncher who developed well early by virtue of countless hours in the gym and ring , Bobick had an outstanding amateur career that included a win over Cuba 's famous Teófil Stevenson at the 197 Pan American Games . Bobick added another future champion to his list when he beat Larry Holmes to be named to the 1972 U.S. Olympic boxing team for the Munich Olympics . Bobick was rated a star at this early stage , and may have been very overconfident as he met Stevenson again during the Olympic trials . Despite Bobick winning the second round , Stevenson knocked Bobick down in the third and the contest was stopped . Bobick trained hard to start his pro career , which did not begin until the following spring , 1973 . Bobick trained with and was managed by heavyweight legend Joe Frazier . Bobick 's first match was against Tommy Burns . He sent Burns to the canvas four times on his way to a first-round KO . Bobick had 14 other fights in 1973 , winning them all by KO , including a win over former contender Manuel Ramos . Bobick won his first 19 fights by knockout . He had 10 more fights in 1974 , winning them all again , eight by KO . Knockout wins that year included Ted Gullick and future champion Mike Weaver . He also decisioned veteran boxer Billy Daniels . Bobick was now 25-0 with 23 KOs . He was then rated by many to be the sport 's new " White Hope , " taking that label from then-declining Jerry Quarry . Frazier himself was approaching retirement and focusing on upcoming paydays with protege Bobick . Bobick gained top-10 ranking in 1975 with eight more fights and wins , all again by KO . He was now being dodged by some , but a win over Randy Neumann proved he could not be ignored . He had a tentative contract with Muhammed Ali in 1976 , but the fight never materialized . Instead he met and defeated Larry Middleton , fellow Minnesotan Scott LeDoux , Bunny Johnson and Chuck Wepner among his five 1976 fights , all wins with two KOs . Bobick had now improved enough as a boxer to be a legitimate title threat . He took a 38-0 record with 34 KO 's into the ring against powerful former champion Ken Norton in May 1977 . The two punchers went right after each other . Norton connected first and very hard . Following up on the staggered Bobick , Norton also landed a hard punch to Bobick 's windpipe but was never penalized . The fight lasted just one minute before Bobick was counted out . Bobick was widely criticized after the Norton match and dismissed by many . Saturday Night Live made fun of Bobick by showing footage of his Nationally televised knockout loss , over and over again . Despite that , he was back in the ring two months later , winning a rematch with Scott LeDoux . He finished the year 1977 40-1 with 36 KO's . In 1978 , he was upset by South African puncher Kallie Knoetze for his second KO loss . He fought eight more times against second-tier fighters in 1978 , winning all by KO . He was looking to return to top-level contention in 1979 when he was KO 'd by future beltholder John Tate . Another KO loss to George Chaplin that year led to an announcement of retirement . His pro record was 48-4 with 42 KOs with wins over several notable contenders . All four of his pro losses were by KO . Bobick returned to Minnesota and took heavy industry work before a machine accident nearly killed him in 1997 . After that he went into coaching and public speaking , using his still-present celebrity to encourage and help others . In November 2006 , Bobick was elected as a city councilman for the City of Little Falls , Minnesota . Bobick also tried his hand at acting as , naturally , a boxer in Billy boy in 1979 . His brother Rodney also was a professional boxer with a 37-7 record .
A Dutch-Australian is an inhabitant of Australia with full or partial Dutch ancestry , the majority of these people were part of the Dutch diaspora . The history of the Dutch and Australia began in 1605 with Captain Willem Janszoon , a Dutch seafarer , landing on the Australian mainland , one of the first Europeans to do so . A number of Dutch people from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) found their way to Australia during World War II and fought with Allied forces . The Netherlands East Indies government operated from Australia during the war . Eleven Free Dutch Submarines operated out of Fremantle after the invasion of Java , the joint No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron RAAF , established in 1942 and No. 120 formed at Canberra , was a combined Dutch and Australian Squadron with dual command , it used B-25 Mitchell bombers , paid for by the Dutch Government before the war . No. 18 later moved to northern Australia , No. 120 to Western Australia and later transferring overseas .. Dutch settlers in Australia arrived as part of Australia 's post World War II assisted migration program , and from Indonesia after it achieved independence .

Eduard Hitzig ( February 6 , 1839 - August 20 , 1907 ) was a German neuropsychiatrist from Berlin . He studied medicine in Berlin and Würzburg . He had as instructors , famous men such as Emil Du Bois-Reymond ( 1818-1896 ) , Rudolf Virchow ( 1821-1902 ) , Moritz Heinrich Romberg ( 1795-1873 ) and Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal ( 1833-1890 ) . He received his doctorate in 1862 , and subsequently practiced medicine in Berlin and Würzburg . In 1875 he became director of the Burghölzli asylum , as well as professor of psychiatry at the University of Zurich . In 1885 Hitzig became a professor at the University of Halle , where he remained until his retirement in 1903 . Hitzig is remembered for his work concerning the interaction between electrical current and the brain . In 1870 , Hitzig assisted by anatomist Gustav Fritsch ( 1837-1927 ) , applied electricity via a thin probe to the exposed cerebral cortex of a dog without anesthesia . They performed these studies at the home of Fritsch because the University of Berlin would not allow such experimentation in their laboratories . What Hitzig and Fritsch had discovered is that electrical stimulation of different areas of the cerebrum caused involuntary muscular contractions of specific parts of the dog 's body . They identified the brains ' " motor strip " which is a vertical strip of brain tissue on the cerebrum in the back of the frontal lobe which controls different muscles in the body . In 1870 Hitzig published his findings in an essay called " On the Electrical Excitability of the Cerebrum " . This experimentation was considered the first time anyone had done any " localized study " regarding the brain and electrical current . However this was not the first time Hitzig had experienced the interaction between the brain and electricity ; earlier in his career as a physician working with the Prussian Army he experimented on wounded soldiers whose skulls were fractured by bullets . Hitzig noticed that applying a small electrical current to the brains of these soldiers caused involuntary muscular movement . Apparently Hitzig 's crude experimentation was inspired by work of 18th century physicist Luigi Galvani who noticed this same electrical phenomena on the brains of frogs . Hitzig and Fritsch 's work opened the door to further " localized testing " of the brain by many others including Scottish neurologist , David Ferrier . Google Ask.com
Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod ( English : " A Song of Love and Death " ) ( 1999 ) is a German and Hungarian co-production , filmed in German and starring German and Hungarian actors from various countries . Its Hungarian title is Szomorú Vasárnap . Although the movie centers on a romantic love triangle with tragic consequences , it has a strong history background , set in World War II Hungary .

András falls in love with László 's lover and beautiful waitress Ilona who inspires András to write his only composition . The resulting song Gloomy Sunday ( German translation : Trauriger Sonntag ) is at first loved and then feared by the public , for its melancholic melody triggers off a chain of suicides . For a while Ilona lives in harmony with both men . The German businessman Hans is a regular patron at the restaurant ; equally , he falls in love with Ilona but she rejects him . He tries to commit suicide by jumping into a river , but László saves him and Hans returns to Germany . After a few years Nazi Germany captures Budapest and Hans returns .

The field exploits horizontal drilling technology by perforating the productive rocks parallel to the beds , rather than through a vertical well perpendicular to the relatively thin Bakken Formation . At Elm Coulee Field , the Bakken is only about 45 feet thick and lies at depths of 8,500 to 10,500 feet , but horizontal wells penetrate 3,000 to 5,000 feet of the reservoir rock , a porous dolomite of Devonian age that probably originated as a large carbonate bank on the western flank of the basin . The field is a stratigraphic trap . In 2006 , Elm Coulee was producing about 53,000 barrels of oil per day from more than 350 wells . Ultimate production is expected to exceed 270,000,000 barrels , with some estimates as high as 500,000,000 barrels . Production at Elm Coulee has more than doubled the oil output of the state of Montana .

EZ2DJ is a series of music video games created by the South Korean company Amuseworld . The basic manner of gameplay is similar as in the Konami 's Beatmania series ; however , as the franchise continues , it differs in style of music and gameplay . The first edition of EZ2DJ was introduced in 1999 and the most recent version , ' 7th TraX - Resistance - Version 1.50 ' was released in December 2007 .

There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen , and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine . The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks , so that both players may use their own headphones to enjoy the game 's audio . Using headphones does not disable the external speakers . EZ2DJ cabinet features four red effector buttons , located at the top of the controller part . However , unlike the Beatmania series ( including III and IIDX ) , depending on the gamemode , effector button are treated as a gameplay button , especially in the gamemode " Radio Mix " , where each player need to control 2 effector buttons . Essentially this is very similar to the 7 key mode of beatmania IIDX , but due to the location of these effector button --- located in a row right at center of the console panel , right underneath the screen and away from the keyboard --- it makes it even more difficult than beatmania IIDX in some occasion ( especially since it also use the pedal ) . Also , another gamemode named " Space Mix " uses all four buttons along with all keys and turn tables ( excludes pedals ) , becoming the hardest gamemode in the game . The pedal is used in all gameplay and treated as a gameplay button . But , in Space Mix , it is used as speed adjustor . EZ2DJ 's passing system is known as the " survival gauge " ; one needs to keep the gauge above 0% until the end of song to pass , similar to systems used in many dance-simulation games .

The Fairfax Connector is a public bus service provided by Fairfax County , Virginia , and operated by Veolia Transport under contract . The first buses rolled out in September 1985 as a lower-cost alternative to the Metrobus service of the regional Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority . The original routes connected the southern part of the county ( near the Mount Vernon Estate ) to the Huntington Metrorail Station which borders Alexandria . This area continues to be the core of the system , and is noted for the number of residents in the Richmond Highway area who use the service at all times of the day . The Fairfax Connector , or simply " The Connector " , has since expanded to 50-odd routes spanning much of the county . In 1994 , the service was extended to the high-technology industrial areas of suburban Reston and Herndon , located between Washington , D.C. and Washington Dulles International Airport . Along State Route 267 ( the Dulles Toll Road ) , express buses carry commuters from free park-and-ride lots to the Washington Metro system . Fares are paid in cash ( exact change ) , paper bus transfer , or a Metrobus weekly unlimited bus " flash " pass . Fairfax Connector deployed SmarTrip readers on its buses in May 2007 , extending the use of this Washington Metro fare-payment system to Fairfax County . Base fare is usually $1 , but can be as much as $3 for express routes . With a Metrorail transfer , fares are discounted to $0.35 exact change from $1 fares , and $2.10 exact change for $3 fares . Senior citizens receive discounted fares ( either $0.50 or $1.00 ) on all buses , or free fare with a Metrorail transfer . Children under age 5 and the disabled ride free on all routes . The following are the line numbers and names that make up the Fairfax Connector bus system .
